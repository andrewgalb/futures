title: AI Marking

For assessment, AI-assisted marking and feedback software goes beyond what has been achieved through multiple-choice quizzes. In STEM subjects, AI-powered tools can help significantly in the semi-automation of marking. Rather than grading hundreds of calculus submissions, an AI tool is very fit for purpose, using a technology called ‘replay grading’ ensuring that similar submissions are not marked twice, and grouping similar answers so they can be given a consistent grade at the same time. Examples of software designed for this use are Gradescope, Graide or the Mobius platform, which can automatically generate unique questions and answers (limiting academic misconduct) and these programs can even read handwritten equations using optical character recognition.
