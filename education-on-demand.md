title: Education on Demand
---

Students aren’t studying in the afternoons after class or on weekends; data shows that the typical student’s primary learning time is 9pm. Although of the primary ways students access material is on their phones or mobile devices, many teachers still prohibit students from using these devices in the classroom.

Today’s educational system is incompatible with the needs of the modern student.

Online education has long been championed as a way to scale education to those who cannot access traditional institutions. Students in India can take robotics classes at Harvard through EdX, while rural villages in Ghana use video to access quality teachers. However, with the costs of higher education continuing to rise, online education also represents an opportunity to dramatically lower costs. Allowing students to learn when and where suits them allows them to stop choosing between ‘learning and earning’, and lowers the burden on traditional institutions that are not designed to cater to thousands of learners.
