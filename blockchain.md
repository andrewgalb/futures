A Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

Historically, universities and schools have owned and controlled student records, leaving students to rely on institutions to access and share their academic history and achievements. Blockchain allows students to have complete ownership of their personal records, allowing them to control their academic identity.
