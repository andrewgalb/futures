title: Decay of arts and humanities
---

With an increase in use of technology in schools, there is no doubt that curriculum will shift to focus on computer science and mathematics. While this change will be in hopes of advancing technology, it will be at the expense of the arts.

As of 2015, only 0.012% of federal spending in the US goes to funding the arts. In order to advance technologically, schools will likely cut music and art programs, which are typically viewed as less crucial to a childâ€™s education.

Space and time will likely be taken from art education, too, as classrooms are converted to computer labs and teachers focus on technology trends rather than music or visual arts. By 2035, there will barely be any outlets for students to express themselves artistically. They will lack mentors, inspiration and encouragement and the flow of creativity in society will suffer for it. Additionally, lack of creative outlets has been shown to affect academic performance and decrease graduation rates.
