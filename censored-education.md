## Censored Education 

With the increase in online classes and technology in the classroom, students will increasingly rely on the internet for information. This opens the door, however, for the already growing issue of censored internet access and therefore censored education in schools.

In 2015, censored internet access has become a prominent issue in countries such as China. The Chinese government began blocking select foreign websites — such as Voice of America, human rights organizations and newspapers — and has advanced its firewalls to filter specific pages and search terms. Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram are only accessible via Virtual Private Networks in China.

In the future, it is likely that governments would take advantage of the increase in online classrooms to provide information that serves their agendas, regardless of historical facts. For example, “Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989” is blocked on Chinese search engines. The threat of restricted internet access creates a dystopian education system by manipulating students’ knowledge base.
