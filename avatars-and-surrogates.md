## Avatars and Surrogates
Human-self education (instruction, consumption and learning) will be complemented by avatars and surrogates.
+ How much will we rely on our physical selves vs. our avatars for our education? Will our surrogates and avatars complement our efforts or simply replace (Bruce Willis in Surrogates)? Will we mostly rely on education in the Metaverse? What role will education providers play in educating us and our avatars? As educators, will our Avatars teach? Some of us may have started using holograms, avatars are next.
+ How will we learn, and how much will our Avatars do the learning for us? Should we aim for/ could we aim to acquire 'desirable knowledge, education and skills' without investing time in learning them?
+	Who gets to choose our Avatars? And how much would we have to pay? Equitable or elitist access?
