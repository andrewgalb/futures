Traditional universities and schools vs. skills and credential based providers.

•	Will universities still provide traditional degrees or will micro and nano credentials dominate? Both can co-exist and grow as demonstrated by EdX.

•	Will a TikTok Varsity and 3 minute tutorials be the largest education provider ?
