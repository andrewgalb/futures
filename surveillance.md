In 2020, tens of thousands of high school students across the United Kingdom took to the streets to protest the use of an algorithm that predicted their end-of-school grades. The algorithm had lowered almost 40% of grades, meaning some pupils were no longer eligible for their chosen university or college. The algorithmic scoring impacted students from lower income backgrounds the most, despite warnings of the ‘potential risk of bias’, raised in a parliamentary education committee a month prior. 

A report from the UK-based organisation Big Brother Watch notes that ‘Children in schools and young adults at universities are subject to state and commercial surveillance perhaps more than any other community in England.’ This data can range from basic personally identifying information like name, date of birth and gender, to browsing history, search terms, location data, contact lists, and behavioral information. It’s a similar story in the US, where according to a report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ‘educational technology services often collect far more information on kids than is necessary and store this information indefinitely’.
