title: Adaptive Learning Platforms
---
One of the most exciting ways to use AI and machine learning is through adaptive learning platforms. Virtual Learning Environments produce a huge amount of usage data daily, and the increased use of digital technologies in the last few years has furthered this. But often this data is overlooked and underutilised. There is the potential for AI models to provide valuable insights that can support learnersâ€™ development, through a fine-grained analysis, for example, providing autonomous learning recommendations, individualised instruction and personalised learning at scale.
