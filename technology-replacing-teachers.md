## Technology Replacing Teachers

By 2035, the role of the teacher will become obsolete, creating drastic job loss and pay cuts. By providing standardized information on a subject online or via holographic professors, schools may completely replace “live” teachers in the classroom.

With the trend of “online classrooms” already becoming prominent, teachers will eventually become facilitators instead of instructors, in the classroom to troubleshoot and provide supervision rather than teach the material. Technology and online classrooms allow students to work independently. Instead of relying on a teacher to provide all relevant information on a subject, students rely on an online program for answers. The disappearance of the traditional classroom has massive implications for teachers. Long-term instructors may lose their jobs or face extreme pay cuts as they become glorified babysitters. Additionally, education programs in college will likely disappear because the profession will no longer be necessary. This also eliminates the mentor relationships between teachers and students and could be detrimental later in life.
