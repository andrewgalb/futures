title: Smart Education and Smarter Humans
---

+ All campuses will be smarter and connected. Bio-tech and info-tech (human- machine interfaces and artificial intelligence) will eliminate or greatly reduce barriers to education (for eg. our avatars) due to disability, income levels, location etc.

+ What will theory development and the research process look like? How much will data and machine learning drive/contribute to theory and research?

+ Will we end up Smarter humans, enhanced humans or part -human, part- machine or machines with a human consciousness?
