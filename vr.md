 VR will solve problems and take education to the next level. Immersive technology allows:
 
+ Pupils to delve into educational materials, regardless of their abilities. According to the CDC, more than 6 million American children have been officially diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In addition, teachers face the problem of the “distracted generation,” when modern schoolchildren who are accustomed to innovation find it difficult to receive traditional education. VR is in front of the students’ eyes, “forcing” them to interact with the environment and memorize the material.
+ To break down language barriers. According to Statista, in 2019 English was a foreign language for 22.6% of US schoolchildren. It is difficult for the newly arrived to adapt and quickly learn the language. They do not understand the material, which affects academic performance. A virtual classroom has a language translation function, so you can organize lessons in any language.
+ To provide inclusion. VR models are easy to adapt to learners with disabilities. For example, some immersive environments change color contrast, font size, or add audio commentary. Special gloves, like SignAloud, are connected to other virtual classrooms. They help to translate the gestures of people with hearing and speech impairments into speech and vice versa.
+ To adapt the process for each participant. In conditions when there are about 30 people in a class, it is difficult to organize personal training. VR gives a chance to measure the productivity of an individual student and adapt the method, teaching style, and pace.
+ To establish learning through practice. Theory without practice is easily forgotten. VR supports experiential learning and students’ interest in the subject. Numerous studies confirm that VR reduces cognitive load, and it is easier for learners to memorize even complex and abstract topics.
